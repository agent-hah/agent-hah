Hi,

I am a Bioengineering student at the University of Pennsylvania with a concentration in Computational Biology. My work sits at the intersection of engineering, machine learning, and healthcare, with a focus on building intelligent systems that translate real-world biomedical data into practical solutions.

About Me

I am passionate about applying computational tools—machine learning, signal processing, and data engineering—to biomedical problems. My experience spans academic research, engineering design, and wet-lab experimentation, allowing me to bridge computational insight with biological reality.

I am currently a Research Volunteer Intern at the Cajigas Lab at the University of Pennsylvania, where I analyze neuronal activity patterns for applications in neuroprosthetic decoding.
